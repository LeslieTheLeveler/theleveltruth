This is my prompt describing the scene. We further evaluated and refined it, so there are some differences, but this will give you the idea.

The movie opens with The Governor arriving at work one day, the camera follows her, West Wing style, as she enters the building and goes about starting her day, she discusses policy with staffers she passes, makes jokes with the mail kid, gets some coffee delivered from the upscale "Starbucks" of the movie world. (If you think this movie won't have consumerism and capitalism commentary, you haven't known me long enough.) A pitch-black funny reference to the The President's Scandal is made. It's implied The Presidents Scandal is sexual in nature and targets children, a direct, unsubtle reference to The Epstein List. The Governor, overhearing the joke but not a part of the conversation, gently punches the staffer on the shoulder with a deviously delivered "You're bad. You're so bad." "Can we use it?" "No."

The single-cut take ends when she enters the Social Media office and a staffer hands her a piece of paper (I'm old, sorry), I mean hands her a tablet to read and says "You're gonna love this!" The upbeat music of the scene slowly degrades into a discordant, jumbled disharmony, as the camera lingers on her face. The expression starts as one of amusement (she's having a good morning, and her staffer acted like she was handing her a joke), to skepticism (a raised eyebrow and twisting of the mouth), to shock (her jaw drops and she places her hand over her mouth), to finally righteous, flaming rage.

The next scene reveals the source of those emotions. In a move promoted as a "security" upgrade, the administration has passed a law that allows them to consider children between the ages of 14 and 17 to be adults when prosecuted for "being here illegally" or otherwise "breaking the law." The Governor, revealed later to be a Juris Doctorate who got her political start as a child activism lobbyist, reveals in a press conference what she found in the law that was passed: It allows the government to designate children that age as an adult for **anything**. Children can now be exploited for their labor without previous protections, the implications for children living "in the closet" are unfathomable, especially with phobic parents, and worst of all, they would be able to lower the Age of Consent to 14 nationwide. She concludes the interview with the most chilling detail: The Law allows the government to change the age restrictions in The Law to anything.

The implications of the law, as well as the blatantly evil intent, motivates The Governor and Leslie to devise The Plan. 

Before the dissolve/transition/whatever, after reading and reacting to the new law, Gov. LƒÅ'au looks up from the tablet, her cheek still bearing a couple tears, but rage burning in her eyes, and says to the assistant behind her: "Sally, what do I have today?"

Scene: Sacramento, California, Capital Park in front of the California State Capitol. The day is sunny, warm, a slight breeze, a perfect, early-summer, North California day. The Host and their Techs are setting getting ready to livestream. The 'set' is an expensive, but portable, collection of high-end telecommunications gear. Three large screens with speakers sit behind The Host's stool, mounted on a collapsible, telescoping frame, high enough up that they can be easily seen and heard from a crowd of standing people. The Host's Stool is a designer piece, but it is crudely and incompletely spray-painted matte black. Next to the stool is a microphone stand, and a small table with a top-end designer laptop. Opposite The Host's stool is a high-end portable digital video camera mounted on an expensive tripod; additional cameras are mounted above the video screen and carried by The Techs to capture the crowd and surroundings.

In the background, angled so the sides aren't really visible, is a large touring bus with The Host's channel Logo on the side. The Logo is in the style of campy Golden Age comics; the background is a solid red 'star burst' (think the "BIFF" and "DONK" effects from the 60s Batman TV show); and in front is a comic book rendering of The Host, holding up their Stool with both hands, cocked back like a weapon, appearing to be charging toward the viewer with an angry, screaming face. 

LESLIE (to TECH 1): "Are we ready?" [Leslie's voice is masculine-coded, loud and fast on their show, but soft and measured in normal conversation.]
TECH 1: "Good to go, Leslie." [These Techs will have names in the final script]
LESLIE (loudly, to the crowd): "You all ready?!"
[The crowd reacts with enthusiasm.]
[LESLIE picks up The Stool and waves it about menacingly, but safely.]
LESLIE (into microphone, amplifying their voice through the speakers): "I SAID ARE YOU ALL READY?!"
[The crowd crescendos, screaming and chanting "LEVEL THEM! LEVEL THEM!"]

[--
The Host is known for their deeply satirical style, angry rants at injustice that use The Stool for both emphasis and comedic effect, unflinching interviews with their video guests, pitch-black (but witty and sincere) sense of humor, guerrilla journalism, and fashion-forward, gender-neutral style. The Show is a web-based livestream that broadcasts from a different location every day, ten months out of the year.
Part of The Show's viral appeal is that the next location in only announced at the end of The Show, so people have very little time to plan to attend. This makes her crowds small but extremely energetic, only the most devout fans who are willing to make/cancel plans on a moments' notice. Leslie encourages their fans to 'express themselves' and 'come as your true self.' The results are a lot of flashy counterculture visuals (like drag) and a lot of protest signs, but also a lot of people who would otherwise be uncomfortable going out in public as their true identity.
The video-interview format allows them to plan interviews in advance and conduct them from anywhere.
There is an ongoing effort among The Host's fanbase (and their detractors) devoted to predicting where they will be on any given day, complete with mathematical models that examine travel time, major urban centers, fan concentrations, suitable shooting locations, and patterns. The Host is famously known for subverting these predictions by planning their tours stops to be nearby, but completely unpredictable, such as broadcasting from remote landmarks (like 'out in the boondocks' remote), underground facilities, the roofs of high-rises, and industrial sites. They almost never ask for permission to use the site (unless it's the day-of and there are safety concerns, such as broadcasting from inside Hoover Dam), preferring public places.
They and their crew have been blocked from setting up and run off by the police, threatened with arrest, arrested, even blacklisted and banned from some cities and entire states (Leslie frequently flaunts these bans, showing up anyway, preaching about Freedom to Travel). These events are shown in a video montage segment of the show prepared ahead of each broadcast. (Part of their team doesn't travel and works in a really cool office/commune, which will make an appearance in the second movie.) The segment is called The First Infringement.
The show's team are often threatened with violence both by their very vocal opposition and indirectly (and sometimes directly) by the police, i.e. "leave or we will, and we'll let the Klan over there do whatever they want;" had their family and freinds doxxed; and have been actually attacked, including with gunfire, on more than one occasion. They deal with this by having an active social media presence and real-time interaction with their local fans. Fans provide intelligence, livestream counter-demonstrations, and even provide security. For particularly high-risk areas or locations, where they know there will be violent resistance, they hire private security.
This is all paid for by immense crowdsourcing and thoroughly vetted ethically endorsements. Leslie Von der Linde-Khan is a worldwide sensation. They don't do interviews with anyone who won't come on their show.

LESLIE (loudly, into the microphone): "Alright!! Let's do this!!"

SMASH CUT to a livestream format, the shot is a live drone stream above the park, showing the crowd, the set, and the Capitol building; the crowd can still be heard. An energetic heavy metal guitar/drum riff combo blares. The Logo appears tiny in the middle of the screen but quick-zooms to fill the frame, as it gets it's largest, blocking all but the very corners of the screen, the music crescendos with a rapid accelerando, topped off by a high-pitched screamer on the guitar and a massive cymbal crash, then The Logo snaps back to it's place (full size this time) in the middle of the screen. As a metalish guitar solo continues playing in the background, a deep Movie Trailer Voice speaks.

TRAILER VOICE (v.o.): [For the intro, the crowd can be heard chant-yelling along] "Nons and Theys, Shes and Hes, and everyone else who doesn't get a voice, it's time for THE LEVEL TRUTH! Live from **Around America**! On the show today are... [the shout-along stops] English acting legend and pit bull lover Sir Patrick Stewart! [In a frame over The Logo, clips of Sir Patrick and screenshots from his social media posts with his foster dogs play silently in a montage. We wouldn't have to get Stewart to play himself, as he does not appear 'live' in the movie, but we should probably get permission to use his likeness. It's only nice. He seems like a decent person, and you have to keep those.] Dean of Harvard Law and animal rights activist, Dr. Natalia Torres! [The clips shows Dr. Torres giving a TED talk, addressing Congress, and other activism; her social media is also screenshotted throughout the clip highlighting her animal rights activism][The shout-along resumes] And for their first ever interview, off the networks, off the censors, off the chain, ON THE LEVEL: [The clips are of Gov. LƒÅ'au's press conference and other public appearances, interspersed with the same screenshots of social media posts. There is a theme to the posts chosen, to highlight a current flame/troll war between LƒÅ'au and President Connors.][A running joke in introducing the last guest is always to give them some ridiculous attribute, playfully for friends, bitingly vicious for enemies; the joke is sometimes relevent, sometimes not, but always funny.] Jurisdoctorate and three-time Grammy award winning producer, California Governor Dr. I√±ez LƒÅ'au!![The last name is pronounced perfectly by the voiceover.]

CUT back to the main camera POV, Leslie is sitting on The Stool and addressing the camera. [Leslie's energy is a barely-contained supernova]

LESLIE (energetically): "Hi everybody! We are LIVE here in beautiful Sacramento, California in front of the historic California Capital! We got a great show for you today, two very different perspectives on pet ownership, and one very popular [crowd noises rise] California Governor... [Leslie waits for the crowd to die down] Streaming from inside THAT building!" [They point at the Capitol, drawing the viewers' (in-universe viewers) attention to it. Leslie has not yet looked where they are pointing, and is caught off-guard when the crowd suddently, almost reverently, quiets down. Leslie notices where everyone's attention is and turns toward the Capitol. From their position, the building is to their back. They hop off their Stool and turn to look.]

[The livestream suddenly jump-cuts to one of the mobile cameras. The camera operator is so excited they can't hold the camera steady; fortunately, it's on an expensive gimbal and the camera hardly notices. It is pointed at a crowd of people leaving the Capitol.]

Approaching from the Capitol's main entrance is Governor LƒÅ'au, accompanied by en entourage of staff, security, and high-ranking lawmakers.
