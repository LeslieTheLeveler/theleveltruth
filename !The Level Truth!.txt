This work was created with the help of a predictive computer, as a tool, not a ghostwriter. I invite you to judge it on its own merit. All creative content was crafted by me, including names, character backstories, individual scenes, themes and plots, and all other non-technical details. No, AI didn't write this, I did. It just helped with my homework. The reasons for this are complex and nuanced, and I'm not interested in that discussion *in this thread*. DM me if you want to know more. If you just want to yell at me, don't bother, I will just block you.

This post contains explicit spoilers for my entire objective, which I have named The Level Truth. And it's long. You have been warned.

This is an early draft, and the *posse comitatus* plot device at The Celebration has been changed for realism to use police, and only one neo-Nazi is killed. The crowd still doesn't riot.

The entire project, including it's name and viral marketing campaign, is an exercise in the darkest, most cynical comedy to examine and address the most relevant technological risks and rewards this modern, dynamic world faces. It addesses some of the most controversial aspects of these discussions with humor and satire, to exaggerate or elucidate for conversation and narrative effect.

I don't even *need* this project to be completed to screen. The plan is to get it into the cultural consciousness and get my ideas out there through viral marketing, word of mouth, and contrasting viewpoints. I expect to get doxxed and outted publicly. I am taking steps to avoid these results and protect me and mine.

What I have done: Massive worldbuilding and character development (not all included here). Organization of goals and tasks. Sample scenes and dialogue. Research, so much research. 

What I need to do: Write the scripts for each episode, probably the most daunting task.

The Outline:

The plot is decidedly:
1. Realistic
2. Political and cynical
3. Progressive-coded
4. Powerfully messaged
5. Hopefully ended

The genre is political thriller/satire/singularity-black comedy/military drama

The humor, which I describe as 'singularity black' in reference to the Anish Kapoor/Vantablack controversy (and the company NanoLab), is parody and satire, but also body horror humor, slapstick, and 'justice porn' humor. There is a LOT of meta-humor, cultural references (but not pop culture, more like serious stuff handled with humor and respect), and deep, layered metaphor, irony, implied meaning, and satire. There are jokes so dark that I can't put them in the show, they have to be in the promotional material like (very dark, trigger warning)[spoiler]describing the bad guy's slave prison as 'TechnoAuschwitz'; a troll digging up a social media post from the Governor's college years that said that if midterms killed her, 'use my ashes for an anthrax bomb scare' at a right-wing news network.[/spoiler]

The cast is extremely diverse, except for some minor characters and the three main villains, who are all 'straight' white men. (In reality, the president's Father, the rival Tech Mogul, and the President are, respectively, an asexual, Mengele-level-evil megalomaniac and torture hobbyist; a pansexual sociopath who sees all people as transactional, and a 'straight' predator who targets children.) Sex barely enters into the narrative; there is virtually no romance and no nudity. The few references to it are mostly about bigotry towards the marginalized. This is a stylistic choice and not a reflection of my values. Sex in the age of instant porn, deepfakes, toxic echo chambers, and ever-present patriarchal structures, is an extremely complex, nuanced, and personal exploration. This narrative does not deal with those topics, and I don't want it to, in this Project. The show's "hard-M" rating will come from its humor and language, which will include, very occasionally, newscasts/livestreams/online videos of bigoted epithets, with appropriate bleeping.

The main themes the narrative discusses:
1. Ethical science, especially regarding vile or unethical experimentation, misinformation in the area, the use of science for evil, and pseudo-science.
2. The Digital Revolution and how it changed our world, for better or worse.
3. Artificial intelligence and its uses and capabilities to assist in causing real harm.
4. Online radicalization in a stark, unfunny "bottle" episode.
5. Religion in sort of an oblique way (that the narrative doesn't really explore, see 'Sex' above).
6. The role of military violence in the modern world. This will be a subplot, but it's a necessary exploration of two important characters. It explores issues like Private Military Contractors and the role science plays in military deployment.

The main plot [All spoilers]:
Season 1:
The first season centers on a populist, progressive governor and a vibrant, cynical independent journalist crafting an audacious plan to take back power in America and curb the tide of right-wing extremism. They use technology, crowd-sourcing, popular opinion, and political savvy to execute their plan. With the aid of allies in the Democrat Party leadership, they redraw blue states, where the Democrats control the legislature, to give them more seats in Congress and take back the majority. The plan works a little too well, and they get a supermajority in both houses. The Democrat leadership wants to use the position to create a 'socialist utopia' with 'progressives' in control. The plan they outline involves a 'benevolent police state' where order is kept by AI-driven social scores and erosion of civil liberties. The heroes threaten to go public with the plan and they agree on a compromise. When Congress reconvenes, they immediately, by Congressional Decree, brand The Republican Party a 'terrorist organization' and arrest the president and senior leaders of the party. The conservatives in the country cry foul, of course, but the terrifying threat of further 'creative interpretation' of the PATRIOT Act that involves sympathizers, they keep quiet... for now. The government seizes Republican assets and uses them to compensate the president's victims and to help build a new conservative party with nuance and consciousness. 

Important scene: 
While this is happening, the president is having a meltdown on social media and his father comes to visit him at the white house. After talking in the Oval Office for a few minutes, the father motions to the door. The walk out to the Sculpture Garden, a tasteless affair that has been built where the Rose Garden once stood. Away from the microphones, he mercilessly berates his son, who looks like a whipped dog. He calmly, but angrily lectures him on how his 'degenerate appetites are embarrasing yourself' and says he needs to tone down the rhetoric and dog-whisting because the father's 'predictive models' said The Governor would make a move soon.

The season culminates in a grand celebration in St. Louis where the Democrats roll out their new agenda. But the heroes have switched the films for the end of the celebration, and after the rock stars and pundits, the film starts. After 35 minutes of policy initiatives that call for the 'socialist utopia,' the crowd is a little riled up. The president had **suspended *posse comitatus*** and the US Army is among the crowd. It's a very tense 35 minutes. The last 10 minutes are the heroes, where they show the Democrat's original plan, complete with surveillance and 'correction.' (Another side note here, this show also won't deal with AI in education, *another whole* ball o' wax.) When a Neo-Nazi pulls a gun on a soldier, he's shot dead (in front of about 2 billion people) then the army efficienctly eliminates about a hundred of his co-protesters, including snipers gunning down the ones who run. The event is livestreamed around the world, and it keeps the rest of the crowd compliant. The film ends with a single word and period on the screen, 'veritas.' The Governor steps to the microphone and basically says "just kidding! lol!" and explains the leadership's plans. She then details the real plan, and annouces she will run for president in 2028 with the Joint Chiefs Chairman as her running mate. It's revealed to the viewer that the Chairman had actually been working with the heroes the whole time and thought of the brutal 'kill you and the man next to you' tactic. He suddenly informs the heroes he has to 'leave for Indiana.'

There is a *coda* to tease the second season. The Chairman arrives at a lush, modern office campus dominated by an enormous, seventy-story skyscraper. The surrounding area is corn fields. When he leaves the car, he slides a USB drive labeled "Operation Moonlight" into his pocket. The Chairman enters a concealed elevator and waves the back of his hand over an unmarked spot above the control panel. The glass elevator rises rapidly through a shaft hidden by one-way glass. Corporate logos flash by and he arrives at the destined floor. He walks down a short hallway and waves the chip in his hand on another hidden panel. The door to the conference room opens, and several people have their faces shadowed, including at the head of the table, a hidden leader, face completely in shadow. Other military leaders are there, along with the tech mogul rival. This 'cabal' casts a macabre, ritualized vote for the ominous-sounding "Operation Moonlight," wherein the Chairman casting the lone dissenting vote.


Season 2:
Season two opens with the murder of the Chairman and a smear campaign against his legacy. The accusations against him are so *profoundly* out of character (really? embezzlement, CSAM, **and** *treason*?), that the journalist immediately focuses on the owner of the facility: the innocuously-named American Fund Directive. They discover a vast network of interconnected and overlapping shell corporations, with hundreds of billions of dollars being pushed around. They find evidence an AFD subsidiary *fomented a coup in a nascent democracy* in Central Africa, to secure the small nation's tantalum extraction rights. The 'president for life' they chose is a genocidal lunatic, but works with the company, accepting billions in favorable trade agreements, lifestyle upgrades, and weaponry for his soldiers. Meanwhile, the governor, now running for president with the journalist as her media director, is unchallenged by a conservative party that can't seem to get its footing. This is due to a genuine, white-nationalist, fascist party suddenly on the scene with seemingly unlimited funding. The Governor easily wins the election but is confused by the weak opponent the conservatives put up, and many large, anonymous donations to her campaign. Dropped in through the first few episodes is brief shots of the Father 'going about his day.' :)

Important scene:
When the Tech Mogul discovers the sheer *scale* of the Father's evil, he reverts to his hacktivist roots, contacts the journalist and offers to work with the heroes to take down the Father. He meets the journalist in Central Park, speaks for but a minute, and then saves them from a manipulated 'hacktivist' suicide bomber. He's severely injured, but gives the journalist a crypto-key. He tells them the Father is behind everything, and gives them access to his company's next-generation quantum AI, then dies. This is during the 'bottle' (as in, bring a bottle) episode I mention above.

After the Tech Mogul's new quantum AI disables the unique encryption, it gains access to the AI training data the Father used to build his predictive models. With the company's five-story quantum computing core, and off-loading non-essential proceses to distributed servers, the quantum AI is able to 'train' on the data in about two weeks. It then presents the heroes with a stunningly rendered holographic display showing the AFD facility. They learn some *really* disturbing things about this *supposed* headquarters of a multinational fund management firm. The sheer magnitude of malevolence on display, and the ultimate goal of the conspiracy, immediately spurs the nation to action. When it is revealed AFD is behind the new party, the white nationalist militias fracture and go home, save the true believers. The remaining militias retreat from accross the coutnry to the facility and take up position in the skyscraper, holding the building's residents hostage, including close to 1,200 kids. The heroes launch a massive, multipronged assault on the facility, with the Governor (now President) tackling the strategic side, while the journalist comes in from the digital side, with the quantum AI. A bloody battle ensues and the slaves are freed.

The season two coda shows the demolition of the facility, after capturing the valueable stuff, and the journalist being appointed the new Cabinet-level Secretary of Science and Technology. Using the repurposed reactor and data center, they build a new science and research facility on the site. Everyone lives happily ever after. The end.


CHARACTERS!!
These are short character descriptions of major and minor and the actors I favor to play them.

The main character is Iñez Lā'au, the current Governor of California. She is a Gavin Newsom-type, zeitgeist-surfing populist, who hides a deep distrust of the institutions she serves because of her history. The child of a Puerto Rican father and a Hawai'ian native mom, she spent at least part of her childhood on the streets of San Juan. She faces constant harassment from the far right, who derisively call her "Inez Luau." She is outwardly playful and jovial, joking with her staff and the like, but conceals a pessimism rooted in realism. As a former child advocate, she's appalled at a new law and finally agrees to appear on The Level Truth, the journalist's multi-platform streaming news show. She surprises the journalist by showing up in person, rather than via video conference. She goes on an emotional rant about the new law, and the journalist is captivated. They begin a bizarre, hilarious journey through American politics and corporate tech, which leads to more than the fight for a nation, but a fight for freedom itself. Iñez starts as an idealistic, but weary, activist, but the realities of politics shape her into a force for good.

Her main companion on this narrative is Leslie Von der Linde-Khan, a non-binary, male-presenting trans online news show host. Their show, The Level Truth, with it's unsual interview styles, unpredictable shooting locations, and raw, unflinching look at the real problems we have make it a global sensation. Despite appearing passionate, rage-filled, and opinionated on the show, Leslie is actually a quiet, cynical individual. They honestly believe that the world is about to end until they meet Iñez. What starts as a joke over drinks turns into The Plan to get rid of the Republican Party and let them start over. Leslie is a blatant self-insert. Their struggles mirror mine and my family's. Part of this work's goal is to draw attention to the very things Leslie rails about in their show. She starts as a cynical neutral narrator, creating my world through their web show, but becomes a humanist hero.


The President, Dudley "Duke" Connors, is a corpulent and disgusting physical presence, but a charismatic and capable politician. He is an unapologetic parody of Donald Trump, in the most vicious way I could think of: he has all of "rumored" [Release the files!] appetites of our current president, and is just **better at everything else**. In fact, he has no morals and no conscience (like Trump). Besides their similar, "alleged," disgusting impulses, he is everything Trump wishes he was: obscenely wealthy, genuinely charismatic, overwhelmingly popular, and sadistically intelligent. He starts off a disgusting lump and ends up forgotten by his father in prison.

Anthony Connors (born Anton Chikunov) is Duke Connors overbearing father and the main antagonist of the entire show, the BBEG. Anthony Connors is a man with virtually no visible personality. His entire image, like a Man in Black, is crafted to leave no lasting memory. He is an ascetic, bald, and fit 84-year old trillionaire. His unimaginable wealth is known only to him, and includes things which have no real calculable, monetary value, but mean immense power, like owning a country's entire supply of tantalum. His desires are not for wealth and power though; those things, including the white nationalst plot to overthrow the US Government and sieze its Nuclear Stockpile, are a means to an end. He would be a cartoon, Golden Age comic book villain if he wasn't so terrifyingly real. His control over the world comes from a hidden place, deep within his Indiana facility: a massively powerful predictive engine called Cocytus programmed with only Anthony Connors' psychopathic, sadistic will as its guiding ethos. He is FUCKED UP. He really, really likes to hurt people. His character grows from being a shadowy cabal leader behind the scenes to being 2 inches of paste on the sidewalk. 

General Ezekiel Nkosi's tale is one of survival and triumph with new opportunities. The child of refugees (from the civil war Connors re-ignited), he was born poor and grew up poor. For lack of options, he enlisted in the army. Through sheer force of will and application of talent, he rose through the ranks to the highest peacetime Army officer and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs. He has unflinching principles and unwavering patriotism. He's one of the last vestiges of the 'old guard,' an Army based on the outdated belief of 20th Century American Exceptionalism. While finding the digital realm difficult, he's still a brilliant strategist and tactician. His military influence allows the heroes to complete their grand stroke without extraneous loss of life; and he's the one who convinces the president to suspend [i]posse comitatus[/i] so he can move material into the crowd and control it. His death at the beginning of season two is the chief motivating factor of the season.

@TTM, Timothy Tiberius Mince (He hates the name, but to me it's a too-subtle pun on the name of Tim Cook [cook/mince? too subtle?]; and his idyl.me name, @TTM, is a 'sacrificial joke' referring to the way I described him in my notes as "The Tech Mogul" before I settled on a name.) - Connors main rival/partner, and a tragic, complex, corrupted individual. His meteoric rise in the tech industry culminated when his company, IDYL, invented [i]transformer architecture[/i] six years before Google did in our timeline. He integrated a powerful Large Language Model into his social media platform, idyl.me, and got Connors attention. Through guerilla finance involving hundreds of shell companies, Connors bought a controlling share in idyl.me. After the hostile takeover, @TTM devised a plan to destroy Connors and take what's his. He leverages his superior empathy to manipulate Connors into seeing the 'son he never had.' Connors takes him on as an apprentice in "true evil," eventually caving and allowing @TTM limited access to Cocytus. With this, @TTM is able to infect Cocytus with a subtle virus that protects @TTM and gives the heroes an edge in the final battle, but the intent was always to get *inside* Cocytus and access its massive server farms to train his new, next-generation, quantum AI called Ideal. He started off as an idealist and activist, but the bitter taste of avarice is seductive, and he lost himself to his billions, 'content' in his 6-story glass penthouse overlooking Central Park. @TTM went from a hardworking, idealist genius to the second richest man in the world, and his redemption only came when he saw what true evil was capable of.

Minor Characters

Ideal is the avatar name of IDyL2, @TTM's next-generation, pseudosentient quantum AI. While not technically a character, it has a 'physical appearance' in VR, appearing as a slight, gender-neutral person with a friendly, albeit mysterious face. It has a verbal interface, unlike Cocytus. It is *immensely* powerful, able to craft, detail, render, and display a 3D, interactable, holographic image of Connors' Indiana facility in real time. Despite the new architecture and quantum core, without the data and brute force computing power of Cocytus, Ideal is little more than a toy. 

Mario Westmoreland is the suicide bomber who tries to kill @TTM. His story is contained in a wrenching, unfunny hour examining the very real power of *online radicalization*. Mario is not an incel with a van, or some poor wretch with a sniper rifle, he is a crafted weapon. His life was stolen from him by Connors and Cocytus on the *off chance* that Connors might have to kill @TTM. On the **off chance** @TTM would betray him, Connors and his AI selected and expertly manipulated a young man with no history of violence, and turned him into a monster. 

Xīn yán O'Connell is Mario's fiance. They both work for IDYL. After Connors manipulates idyl.me to put Xīn yán in front of @TTM for only a minute, he stages Xīn yán's rape and death by an incel stalker to drive Mario over the edge. He publicly speaks out against gaming culture and @TTM specifically, and is fired, an NDA forced on him.

Harry Jay is the patsy Cocytus selects as Xīn yán's murderer. He is kidnapped, and Cocytus poses as him to manipulate Xīn yán and implicate Jay. After the murder, he's left in a tossed, smelly apartment, drugged up on military-grade amphetamines and powerful hallucinagens. He's also given a running chainsaw and covered in blood and what looks like self-harm wounds from the chainsaw. His sudden, terrifying appearance, the cops' equally sudden expletives, and the hail of gunfire is a confined space leave the cops asking wtf just happened. His death is meant to be one of my singularity-black visual gags that's actually really, really funny. It's meant as a narrative pressure valve to release after Xīn yán's horrifying assault and death. Harry was a 54 year old construction worker.

"High General And President For Life" Alphonse Naidimi is the dictator Connors used, via his Russian mineral company, ZoloTech Explorations, to grab all the tantalum in Nkosi's country. If Nkosi knew this, he probably would have strangled Connors at the cabal meeting. Naidimi is a genocidal lunatic but methodical and intelligent; and his last name is a deliberate anagram of Idi Amin. 

COMNAVSPECWARCOM Rear Admiral Amari Laveau - The US Navy SEALs Commander and one of the leaders of the assault on the facility. This no-nonsense 'American assassin' is one of the finest killers alive. He found Nkosi, in spite of his archaic idea on the application of force, to be a loyal patriot and a great role model. He is a square-jawed, dour individual most of the time, who doesn't trust civilian military leaders after his parents were killed in Hurricane Katrina.

Dr. Nia Laveau, Vice President for Computational Neuro-oncology at Bailey-Fielding Labs, is Laveau's wife and confidant. Perfectly aware of her spouse's abilities and job, she makes his life easier with humor and cute nicknames. They live in a modest brownstone in Fort Greene.

Captain Xochitl "Roddy" Rodriguez is Laveau's second in command and highest-ranking woman SEAL. No one seems to be able to pronounce her first name successfully, so she has gone by 'Roddy' since childhood. She's the only one besides Nia that can bring him out of his shell and make him smile once in a while. Their back-and-forth during a video call with Nia, while taking a break from Ideal's holographic 'Dr. Monstrous' Happy Fun Time Torture World and Corporate Offices Presentation' to grab a drink.

@nkl_bak_alwys_sukt - The online, in-game persona of 54-year-old constuction worker Harry Jay, in the IDYL game "Aspect of Dominion." After Jay is kidnapped, Cocytus poses as '@nkl' in the game chat to frame him for Xīn yán's rape and murder.

@psyops_arent_real_really - A 'female-coded' 'hacker' persona created whole cloth by Connors and Cocytus to manipulate Mario into killing @TTM. 'She' is a sympathetic ear to Mario's plight, while giving him validation and resources without arousing his suspicions.



MAJOR PLOT DEVICES

#Veritas! - Started as a joke on a hacktivist forum, it spread to the Internet at large some time in the late 2010s. It's spread is fueled by idyl.me that, at about the same time, started allowing special characters in hashtags. Both ends of the polictical spectrum and everyone in between use it unironically, accusing the other side of appropriating it. Companies have co-opted it for advertising, but totally miss the point, as usual, e.g. "We have the best pizza! VERITAS!" It has come to mean "My Truth" to a lot of people and appears everywhere. In case it wasn't obvious, the use of homophones, initials, capitalization, and punctuation in the show are a nod to the subtle ways advertisers and manipulative agents mess with our psychology.

American Fund Directive - Connors' conglomerate. The name is both an attempt at a bland, unnoticeable corporate title, and a tangential reference to the German AfD party, indicating its nefarious purpose. Its subsidiaries are as varied as the modern corporate landscape and include a self-perpetuating aparatus like a wealth management company and a law firm to which AFD is their only client. 

National News Network - A right-leaning cable-and-online news organization that has devolved into white nationalist talking points and dogwhistles after being acquired by Connors for his coup plans.

The White America Party - Stylized "The WAP," this party was conceived and funded by Connors to facilitate his acquisition of America and its nuclear arsenal. The acronym choice is deliberate, and the song W.A.P. becomes an anti-fascist, anti-racist anthem after the viral, deeply ironic death of a bigoted WAP supporter has the song playing coincidentally in the background. This is really the only *direct* reference in the movie to a real-life piece of art. Obviously, it constitutes 'fair use' when I'm writing a script as a hobby, but a production would need to pay royalties and get permission. I realize the cliche of calling a weak or cowardly person a 'pussy' is a language phenomenon that is long, long, ***LONG*** past its expiration point, but I don't think Cardi and Megan will mind too much. Also, Nazis are pussies.

IDYL - @TTM's company, a multi-discipline tech conglomerate with gaming, AI, and social media as its primary foci. @TTM uses the immense wealth generated by this company to target Connors without realizing he was getting into the next level of evil. The company's culture, while outwardly progressive and concientious, reinforces the same toxic, patriarchal problems of similar real-world companies. This is especially true in its most popular game, Aspect of Dominion.

idyl.me - @TTM's social media platform and his baby. Everything he has was built on it. Connors steals it in a hostile takeover, starting @TTM's plan for revenge. It's an amalgamation of everything social media. It was lauched in the early-2000s as a 'multi-platform sharing site' featuring (for the time) advanced features like video streaming and live video calls.

Cocytus - Named after the Ninth Circle, also Lucifer's prison, in Dante's *Inferno*, Cocytus is three things: 
	A powerful **Large Language Model artificial intelligence**, with access to zetabytes of training data and a quarter-million bespoke ASICs.
	The Control Center, which only Connors has access to, which rests on the 69th floor of his tower.
	Cocytus Systems, a government-contract AI-powered surveillance suite that Connors secretly has access to. (Palantir)

LIBRUM - The Latin word for 'balance' but also a play on 'book' (libram) which comes from the Latin for 'freedom.' An 'open source neutral AI' built by Connors and Cocytus to help push the disenfranchised white population of America toward white nationalism.

n-agon - the 'anonymous' (see what I did there?) hacktivist group whose forums are always shifting in real-world and digital space, run by the enigmatic elder hacker @jemma666, @TTM's ex-wife.

Aspect of Dominion - A cultural juggernaut and IDYL's second biggest moneymaker, AoD a subscription-based, sci-fi, cyberpunk MMORPG with optional VR interface. When a new 'character' is 'rolled,' they get a new, unique, procedurally generated planet, and can engage in massive player-vs-player raids and multiplayer boss fights. It's a combination of EVE Online and World of Warcraft, with all the accessibility, user-choice levels of engagement, deep dive complexity, and bizarre (often toxic) culture of both of those games.
