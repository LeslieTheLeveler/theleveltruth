Yeah, I just wanted to give the shippers to chew on to help keep the other talk about the alive, and irritate the bigots a little more. I want Eliot Page and Zendaya to play the two character (we'll have to age Zendaya a little).
Connors, who my perfect choice would be either Stanley Tucci or Mark Strong, new 'prince' is TTM (my choice is Colin Farrel). TTM and Connors go way back, TTM started his first tech company in the late 80s, late into the market for personal computers. So he focused on hardware that would *sell*, making attractive, sleek PCs (obvious reference to Jobs, which is important, because TTM started off, if not moral, then at least principled). He becomes allied with Connors, later joining his closest circle, when he releases idyl.me, the first social media multiplatform with video capabilities in the early 2000s and Connors takes an interest. They meet and Connors invests in his company. TTM *immediately* knows something is off. Like a shark when it senses a rival shark in its territory. By this time, TTM is a billionaire, but Connors' wealth actually scares him. By the time of the show, to the public, TTM is "the richest man in the world" an incredibly sarcastic and charismatic "Tech Jesus," as he has been dubbed by the media; "Agent of Satan" and "Antichrist" by various religious organizations [Note 1]; "Dr. Destruction" by the environmental side for his company's disastrous ecological record, especially in developing nations (and he has several PhDs, he's widely regarded as "the world's smartest inventor"); "the godfather of predictive AI" in tech circles for his company's invention of **transformer models** in the early 2010s; and just "Tim" to his ex-wife, elder hacktivist @jemma666. He originally owned a majority share in his company and idyl.me, but Connors leveraged the AI he invented and implemented into idyl.me to build Cocytus. In the events leading up to the show, Connors has effectively taken over idyl.me with a kind of socially-engineered **hostile takeover**, using the company's own AI to manipulate stockholders to sell to AFD. By the time TTM figures this out, it's too late. He was so invested in the next generation of his AI (using a quantum computing-based architecture that made transformer models look like abacuses), he wasn't paying attention to his shareholders. He's also facing **constant anti-trust investigations** so that's also distracting him. In response, TTM starts his own "Operation Moonlight:" using the limited available quantum hardware, he builds an AI that can compete with Cocytus by **smashing** it's predictive capabilities. Cocytus is based on transformer archictecture and LLMs, while the new idyl.me is a **true pseudosentient AI**. **IDyL2** (pronounced "ideal2", note the capitalization difference [Note 2]) will become an actual character in the second season. He uses this AI, with it's less comprehensive hardware and data storage capabilities, plus **human empathy** to figure out Connors' weakness: his age and legacy. (As a younger man, in the 60s, Connors never worried about **death**, a far-off thing. This allowed him to craft a sort of Diogenes of Synope view of death: ["Cast my body outside the city walls" "What about the wild animals, that would devour you?" "Give me a stick."]. He thought planning for his death was pointless, as he wouldn't be around to care. As he aged, he felt the old 'icy finger.' Also, TTM figured out that Connors **hated his son**, who he saw as a lazy degenerate, and who he had a tight psychological control over. Remember The President is a subversion of a parody of Donald Trump: a man of the same cruelty and repulsive appetites of his father, with none of the control. While Connors likes to take his collection of torture instruments down to The Quarries and tortures people who have stood against him (and children, just for fun), he sees his son's pedophilia as an enormous liability because he can't control it. While his plan for **world subjugation** includes getting his son into the White House, his fallback plan doesn't include him. So Connors has a "candle in a tornado" flicker of paternal instinct that has never been satisfied. Because IDyL2 is buit to account for human empathy and emotion, at least superficially, he also figures out Connors needs a **partner**. Despite taking childlike glee in torturing animals, Connors is **still human**. There is a part of him, however small, that requires **validation**. TTM picks up on this immediately and uses manipulation techniques to convince Connors TTM is as evil as him. So setting himself up as an **apprentice**, **kindred spirit**, and **potential heir**, TTM ingratiated himself into Connors inner circle and gets the access he needs to take down Connors if he needs to. Or so he thinks. Bear in mind that Connors and TTM never trusted each other, even at the beginning. Connors is a **sociopathic sadist** who sees other people in a **transactional, raw-material** way. Meanwhile, TTM is a completely **corrupted idealist** which avarice to rival Smaug. He started out believing Tech Was Good and Information Is Free (his marriage to @jemma666 is an indication of this), but as the money and influence grew, so did his desire for it. Refracting Connors' industrialized suffering for his own **gratification**, TTM's avarice is a self-defeating addiction. By the time of the show, TTM's *Moonlight* is ready to launch it's first offensive: the digital infiltration of Cocytus.

Leslie and IÃ±ez' friendship, and whatever the hell the fucked up, mutually abusive thing Connors and TTM have is, are a diametric opposite. L/I is mentor-student, C/T is dictator-general; L/I is based on trust and respect, C/T is based on mutual loathing and mistrust; L/I are physically affectionate (and briefly attracted to one another), hugging and high-fiving frequently through the show, C/T is purely professional and emotionless. [Do these abbreviations make sense? I need a shorthand for 'relationship' (it's a long word).]


[Note 1]: This will be literally only of two references anywhere in my show to religion. I want to keep that entire examination **away from this project**. The only other reference will be how religious extremists throughout history have manipulated people to martyrdom. This is after TTM dies, of course, and only once. The use of AI by religion is a different, very interesting idea for a movie, and is a perfect followup to this show. There's always been a lot of religious themes in cyberpunk, and LLMs are a **super** cyberpunk concept. A dystopian future sci-fi where the world is dominated not by fascism or capitalism, but a single, new religion that used predictive models and insidious "humanitarian" efforts to rise up and globally dominate the human spiritual landscape. Definitely remind me of this if I bring up other projects. Along with my "genetically engineered flying lizards Jurassic Park parody/satire monster horror movie" called **Pterror from the Skies**. (The words pterodoton, pterosaur, and pterodactyl do not appear anywhere in the film. It's literally an **alternate history** where nothing is different except a pterosaur skeleton has never been discovered/they never evolved.) The tag line would be *pronounced* 'keep your eyes on the skies' in audio rendering/voice over, but would stylistically be marketed as "Pkeep your eyes on the skies." Comment on both film ideas with a brief overview of similar fiction, then log these two for later.
[Note 2]: Capitalization plays a minor-ish narrative role in the show, like the various uses of 'veritas.' This is only because the minor (and not so minor) psychological effect of capitalization is interesting to me.
