Add this data point to the stream: I will use italics (*Governor* and *President*) to refer to the two film titles. I will still use an article when referring to the two characters (The Governor and The President).

**CHARACTERS**
### The Governor: Iñez Lā'au
**Codenames:** The Governor, Madam Governor, Madam President
**Synopsis:** Iñez Lā'au is a preternaturally charismatic and astute politician of mixed Hawaiian and Puerto Rican descent. Her backstory is rooted in a childhood spent partially on the streets of San Juan, Puerto Rico, which gives her an unassailable moral compass regarding the plight of the downtrodden. She is driven by a profound exasperation with a broken political system and is compelled to act after the passage of an abhorrent law targeting children. Her public-facing confidence is a façade for a private idealism that has been tempered by a cynical reality. She is the central protagonist of both films, serving as the primary narrative engine. In **Madam Governor**, she orchestrates a high-stakes political gambit that brings down her enemies. In **Madam President**, she is a leader besieged by the unforeseen consequences of her own actions.
**Casting:** Zendaya, whose emotional gravitas and commanding presence make her a perfect fit for a character with such complex inner conflict.

### The President: Dudley "Duke" Connors
**Codenames:** The President
**Synopsis:** Dudley "Duke" Connors is a theatrical and corpulent man of genuine charisma, but his potent magnetism belies a complete lack of conscience. He is, in actuality, a powerful puppet for his more sinister father, and his motivations are driven by pure ego and a gluttonous hunger for power. He is the public-facing instrument for the cabal's grander design. He is the main antagonist of **Madam Governor**, and his oppressive legislation is the inciting incident that forces The Governor to act. His defeat and imprisonment at the end of the first film are a crucial part of the satire, as it reveals that he was never the true enemy. His ultimate fate is one of irrelevance.
**Casting:** Aaron Eckhart, who is adept at portraying charismatic figures with a dark interior. His ability to project both charisma and an underlying menace makes him an ideal fit.

### The Host: Leslie Von der Linde-Khan
**Codenames:** The Host
**Synopsis:** Leslie is a masculine-presenting, non-binary trans person who embodies the contradictory spirit of the modern digital age. Their public persona is that of a sardonic but genial vlogger, whose deadpan humor and incisive commentary have garnered a massive online following. Privately, they are a bitterly cynical and nihilistic individual who has become disillusioned with the very fame that elevated them. Their backstory is one of personal liberation through the internet, a platform where they were able to discover and express their identity after a childhood of repression. In **Madam Governor**, they function as a Greek chorus and narrative conduit, providing the audience with on-the-ground commentary. In **Madam President**, their role transitions from an observer to a pivotal hero, using their crowdsourced hacktivism to become The Governor’s co-protagonist.
**Casting:** Eliot Page, who would bring unparalleled authenticity and powerful emotional resonance to the role.

### The Father: Anthony Connors (born Anton Chikunov)
**Codenames:** The Father, The Leader
**Synopsis:** Anthony Connors is the diminutive and ascetic mastermind behind the entire conspiracy. In stark contrast to his son's theatrical extravagance, he is a man of quiet, strategic ruthlessness. His motivations are rooted in a desire for total, discreet control, and he sees American democracy as a chaotic and inefficient system, a market ripe for domination. He is the principal architect of the fascist plot, leveraging his immense wealth and clandestine connections to orchestrate the chaos that his son presides over. In **Madam Governor**, he is the hidden antagonist, an almost mythical figure revealed only in the final scene. In **Madam President**, he emerges from the shadows as the central, overt antagonist, whose plot to stage a fascist coup becomes the primary threat.
**Casting:** Stanley Tucci, whose calm, measured demeanor and immense screen presence would make him a quietly menacing and formidable villain.

---

### The Tech Mogul: (No Name Yet)
**Codenames:** The Tech Mogul
**Synopsis:** A product of the digital age, the Tech Mogul is a fusion of a charismatic "techbro" and a cynical capitalist. His public persona as a bombastic visionary conceals a cold, opportunistic individual who is motivated by the exploitation of data and misinformation for financial gain. His backstory is a tragic descent from idealism to nihilism. He began as an innovator but evolved into a ruthless pragmatist who profits from human venality. In **Madam Governor**, he is a secondary antagonist who provides the technological infrastructure for the cabal. In **Madam President**, his assassination by a patsy—manipulated by his own algorithms—drives the sequel's plot, as The Host uses crowdsourced hacktivism to uncover the cabal's plans.
**Casting:** Colin Farrell, an incredibly versatile actor who could embody the character's public bravado and inner moral decay.

---

### The General: Ezekiel Nkosi
**Codenames:** The General
**Synopsis:** Ezekiel Nkosi is a career military officer and a man of unwavering principle who believes in the democratic ideals the military is sworn to protect. His loyalty is to the Constitution, not a political party. He initially supports The Governor's plan, believing it to be a necessary evil. However, his idealism is tested when he witnesses The Father's true and totalitarian ambition. He serves as a tragic moral compass. His final, single dissenting vote against the cabal's true agenda is a powerful moment of defiance that makes him a martyr. His death in the first film sets the stage for the second, where his memory inspires The Governor to fight the true enemy.
**Casting:** Giancarlo Esposito, who has the perfect acting range to portray a conflicted but principled character operating under a code of honor.




***Madam Governor* Act I**

In the first act of *Governor*, The Governor and The Host meet and become friends. The first act is focused on the heinousness of the President's plans and their growing kinship. It is in this act that The Plan starts to take shape, in on scene, one of the two main characters, while joking about the Administration, suggests something like: "We should just arrest all the Republicans when we get elected." While they both laugh, their giggles end with them looking at each other like they each had a **really bad idea**. 

***Madam Governor* Act II**

2.  The second act of *Governor* is the formulation and first steps of The Plan. The MC's discuss the ethics of their plan and both agree it's a necessary risk because of the stakes. This is meant to imply The Plan is not The Governor's alone, but both. While The Host, in the first film, is The Greek Chorus (using their online-only, independent commentary and interview show called The Level Truth [called The Show as a notation] as their method of telling the audience about the film's world), this is to foreshadow their role in the second film and reveal an important character trait: beneath their cynical worldview lies their profound, but flexible, core morals. They possess a powerful sense of justice dulled by a world that tells them to 'keep it to yourself,' while having an intense, but inconsistent integrity. This is a trait of both main characters, which manifests as the goal of The Plan: tear down the Republican Party and let the conservatives start over, showing them how to be conscientious and nuanced. The President is both the characters' impetus for bending their morals to make the world a better place. It's also one of the more unflinching core messages of the film: The Republican Party has to go. It's the only way. The organization is too corrupt to save. 

***Madam Governor* Act III**

3. At the beginning of the third act of *Governor*, the **midterm Congressional** election (you said presidential election) is an incredible success. The Democrats win a**supermajority** in both house of Congress (this is a bit of a hand-wave, it's probably not even possible), enabling them to enact the last stage of The Plan: declare the Republican Party a **terrorist organization** and arrest their leaders, seize the Party's assets to fund their (actual) new agenda, and finally The Celebration: at a massive media bonanza hosted in St. Louis, Missouri where the Democrats will roll out their new agenda.
At The Celebration (which requires rerouting interstate highways to be one-way and the construction of a massive, luxurious tent city for people who can get there, but can't afford to spend the night), after the rock stars play and the pundits and politicians all make their big, hopeful speeches about a socialist utopia, it's announced that Governor Iñez Lā'au will be running for president in 2028, with The General as her **Vice President** and she will speak after The Agenda Film. What follows is a big-budget, star-studded, 45 minute film on a 100 meter screen, with speaker towers throughout the entire 3-million-strong crowd, simulcast worldwide by The Host and their cyber-allies.
In the first 35 minutes, the film depicts what everyone is expecting: free food, shelter, education, legal representation, etc, for anyone who can't afford it; expanded refugee acceptance; descheduling and legalizing marijuana akin to alcohol and nicotine; ETC ETC. This is shown in the movie as a series of news broadcasts (including NNN, which doesn't know what to say on the air for fear of the new implication that supporting Republicans can get you sent to Guantanamo Bay) and livestreams from the crowd and around the world. Obviously the voices online are louder (and beet-faced guy in Mirrored Sunglasses (this will be my code for rabid Republican supporters on the internet) might say "You watching this shit, man? They want to let *anybody* in!"). This montage will last about 10 to 12 minutes then it cuts back to the main crowd's perspective.
The tone of The Agenda Film suddenly shifts, and the music becomes ominous. A bright, cheerful environment is replaced with black-and-white for the rest of the film. A big-name actor voice over (maybe Morgan Freeman) says, as calmly and serenely as the rest of the film: "But... there are some who would disagree with our vision for a better world." (Because this **is** a comedy, the sign language interpreter, after finishing translating the line, **dramatically** makes the sign for 'sad.' The sign for "sad" is made by placing both hands in front of your face, palms in. Bring both of your hands down the length of your face. Tilt your head forward slightly, and make a sad face.) The film shows Putin, Kim Jong Un, and the dictator Connors' "owns" to get his uranium (although the heroes don't know this yet) interspersed with fictional billionaires (some of whom are in the coda) known in-world as being laughably unethical, like The Tech Mogul (The Father is not shown). Also shown is real-life imagery of Trump's real-life villainy: ICE raids and immigrant concentration camps, for example. There is no commentary on this. It's literally just shown in black and white (some things are absolute). A blatant reference to Duke Connors' pedophilia is made in the visuals, along with a photo of a tweet that says the in-world equivalent of "RELEASE THE EPSTEIN FILES." After the 'better world' line, the screen turns to black and the words "DISTURBANCE WILL NOT BE TOLERATED" are shown, translated into several major American languages, including their cultural alphabet.
The last 10 minutes of the film are a series of increasingly draconian **police state** laws enforcing the new 'vision.' The same moderate, soothing voice describes absolutely **insane** policies for today's America, like arresting people for hoarding wealth; AI-driven **social media scores** for all Americans 18 and over; interpretations of **anti-trust** to break up major corporations: not just the new tech-bro hustles, but companies like GM, IBM, and Chase; ETC ETC. The Last Ten Minutes is shown and heard in-movie in real time. The monologue is a consistent volume as the scene shifts from the images from The Agenda Film to peoples' reactions to the dead silent 3 million people. The NNN broadcast goes silent, as the newscasters flee the studio, leaving the equipment on. Mirrored Sunglasses is also dead silent, eyes wide.
Also, and this is kind of important, heavy military equipment like tanks, armored personnel carriers with mounted MK-19s, and trucks full of soldiers, starts moving through the crowd. These are supplied by The General. The soldiers are armed with live ammo and are willing to methodically, exactingly use it. This is demonstrated when a group of about 100 Nazi Swastika-wearing idiots tries to leave, and the soldiers won't let them. They try to push past the soldiers, but are beaten back and warned. A large skinheaded man produces a machine pistol and the soldiers kill them all, including snipers being used to take down runners. This is seen by everybody in the world, as several of the livestreamers and network cameras in the crowd had turned their attention on the pushing altercation. This ties into The General's role in the film and what he represents; I'll get to that in a minute. The military response was planned exactingly by The General to be such a massive show of force that, even if there was violence in a small area, the entire crowd wouldn't stampede. He is aiding in designing this strategy by The Host.
The Agenda Film ends with the same black screen and font as the disturbance warning, centered on the screen: "veritas." (all in lower case, with a period, in contrast with its use through the film, as several spotlights illuminate The Governor as she walks up to the microphone. I haven't written her speech yet, but the first line is "That's what we could have done." She then gives a short speech on fascism and the threats facing democracy in America. She ends the speech by announcing that everything else in The Agenda Film is accurate, as the screen changes to an **extremely diverse** crowd of people wearing traditional clothing in bright colors. The initial colorful tone of the screen returns as she says "because we live in a world, as well as a nation." She concludes that she and the rest of the Democrat Party will help the conservatives build a Party for the future, not even mentioning the Republican Party. She asks everyone to be safe and respectful in the following days and weeks as the country heals. She finishes her speech and starts to turn away from the podium, the stops. She turns back and says "Of course I'm still running for President."

(From now on, I will use the following code words, capitalized, with an article: The Arcology refers to the entire structure, from Connors' residence to bedrock. The Skyscraper refers to just the above-ground floors and basements. The Pit refers to the top 10 floors. The Quarries is both the in-universe and code word for the hidden, underground facilities at The Campus.)


***Madam Governor* Coda**
The General arrives by limosine to the American Fund Directive Campus and enters the parking garage of The Arcology. This is the first time The Campus is shown in the film, and it's not revealed where it is or even who owns it. Several stories down, the driver activates a remote control and a section of wall opens, revealing a large, separate, hidden garage with several limosines and expensive cars. He exits the vehicle and walks to an innocuous-looking glass elevator. The elevator quickly rises through the first 60 floors, but then slows and stops at the 61st. The offices of the American Fund Directive, including the Noble Pagans relief, are visible through **one-way glass**. This is meant to show the building has a lot of hidden areas. He then steps to the control panel and places the back of his right hand against a seemingly random part of the wall above the panel, a concealed LED shines for a few seconds and goes off. (Symbolism: The Mark of the Beast from the Book of Revelation, this is important later.)
The elevator continues to rise. Passing each floor, the audience can see the company logo and theme of the offices of each. The windows of the elevator darken as it passes through what seems to be an overly thick floor. The light returns when The General arrives on the 69th floor. There is a single, short hallway and a high-tech security door. Using his hand on the doorframe, the lock clicks and the door slides open.
He enters a darkened conference room. Innocuous screens on the walls, their colors and brightness muted as well as their sound, show stock tickers, newscasts, etc. He takes his seat the conference table. He is the last to arrive. Among the others around the table are The Tech Mogul, other **four-star** military officers, and three other billionaires from The Agenda Film.
The shadowy figure at the head of the table says, "Now that we have our quorum, the votes shall be cast." Everyone except him stands up and places their hands, palm-down, on the table. Except The General. He calmly puts his hands in his pockets.
Anthony Connors leans forward, revealing to the audience that he is head of an international cabal.
"You know what this means." It is not a question.
"I do."

***Madam President* Act I***
Act I of *Madam President* is about Iñez Lā'au's campaign for President, while Leslie helps her with the digital side. Their friendship grows, but is tempered by a new player on the American political arena: An well financed, ultra-white-nationalist party that can almost match Leslie's media influence. This new party, literally called The White America Party, gains significant traction in the polls and online. Leslie first role as a hero instead of an observer is to try to manage the misinformation The WAP [this is a new code] puts out: European people are superior, trans people are crazy, blah, blah, blah. The name is a reference to a recent popular song and the dual meaning of the word 'pussy.' [I hesitated to put this detail in the film. My first objective is to be as inclusive as possible with my film project. Calling a weak or cowardly person a 'pussy' is a usage ***LONG, LONG PAST*** it's expiration date. But I really, really couldn't resist the pun. This is a comedy after all. Also, Nazis are pussies.]
This will be briefly alluded to in the film.
Scene: a busy commercial district in a major city is crossed by a highway. There is a long light at the cross-streets to favor the higher volume highway.
Asshole #473 pulls his jacked-up truck with a WAP bumper sticker up to a stop light, he notices **three bystanders** at the intersection:
1. Leo, a Latino teenager with colorful clothing and what appear to be gang tattoos covered up with a homemade tattoo gun.
2. Dr. Mandal, a psychology professor at the local college.
3. Arty, a flamboyantly dressed, effeminate young white man.
As the camera goes from each framing shot of the bystanders back to Asshole #473's face, his bigotry is telegraphed:
For Leo, the expression of fear, he gently strokes the weapon under his shirt, in the front of his pants.
For Dr. Mandal, a satisfied scowl-frown at his clothes and manner, implying he sees South Asians as an **ideal minority.**
For Arty, the look is pure disgust, but lingers.
While engaged in his the internal dialogue that he will definitely be posting on his idyl.me account later, another car pulls up next to him at the intersection. It is a sleek, modern sport hybrid with T-tops, A473 can see right down into the car from his rediculous vehicle. The two occupants are both women, both POC, and are holding hands over the central console. They don't notice him, because they are singing along and dancing in their seats to their stereo, playing W.A.P. by Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion, extremely loudly.
He rolls down his window and attempts to yell something homophobic and racist, but his voice cannot be heard over the music. The couple don't even notice him, and he gets so pissed, he floors the gas and runs the red light, immediately running into a Tyson Chicken semi (chicken joke, I can do those too). The impact spins his truck around facing the couple in the car. The Bystanders and The Lesbians in the Car see this whole thing, watch the man angrily try to open his door, fail because it is jammed by the impact, cross the truck to get out the other side, only to find that door is jammed as well. Still very, very angry, he then uses a tire iron the broken glass of his back windshield to make a hole big enough to crawl through, bloodying his hands as he struggles with the **safety glass**. When he stands up, he starts a series of hilarious physical comedy.
1. As he stands up in the bed of the truck, hits his head on a misshapen part of the semi-trailer that ended up above the bed, he then stumbles and falls out of the truck onto the pavement.
2. He gets up and tries lean on the truck for support, his hand slipping on the blood, and falls down again.
3. Managing to get up, he tries to brush the broken glass out of his hair and clothes, only to smear both with blood.
4. His brain kicks back in and he realizes where he is and what's going on. He sees the couple, and starts to run toward them, murder in his eyes.
5. Everyone is staring at him: the Bystanders, the Lesbians in the Car, a large crowd of onlookers, several of which are livestreaming [Note 1]. He pulls out his Gun, a ridiculous .50 caliber IMI Desert Eagle. He decides the women in the car, since they started this, will feel. his. wrath. He takes three determined steps toward them, and is immediately and brutally mowed down by a Police APC on it's way to a swatting call. All three Bystanders look at the Lesbians and nod. The couple turn their music up louder and speed away, laughing.
