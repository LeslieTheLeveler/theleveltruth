Last episode coda:

Iñez and Leslie announce a really, really important policy initiative to be announced at the AFD campus. It is **publicly announced** that the policies are **already publicly available**. This is kind of a big thing because, although they are extremely popular, Iñez and Leslie are not widely **trusted** because of **how** they defeated the Connors family and the "reveal" of The Celebration and The Agenda Film at the end of the last season (with its associated videos of the brutal execution of the Nazi). At this point in the narrative, the final plans for the location of the Nkosi Labs (as they might be known in potential sequels/spinoffs) have not been finalized, but there has been a lot of discussion on repurposing the Campus buildings and reactor/server farms (but not the Arcology, although it's underground infrastructure should be kept for power distribution, etc) and build the Labs around them. Others argued that even The Campus, with the ghost of the most horrific prison ever built under it, was still too fresh in the collective memory. The final decision is left to Iñez, who says she will announce her decision at the policy press conference at the campus. The scene is thus: when reporters arrive at the location designated, everything is already set up for the announcement, and what that will be: Secret Service is already there, securing the site; the big, gaudy frame with the ribbon and giant scissors are already there. It looks like Iñez has made her decision. When she arrives and takes the podium, the Campus to her back, she makes a short speech before the ribbon cutting ceremony. From where they chose the press conference, an elevated area fairly distant from the Campus, but with the Arcology (whose demolition will be a complicated task that is *supposedly* still in the planning stages) and the Campus buildings still quite visible, the reporters infer that Iñez wanted to create some **narrative distance** between the old horror of the Connors family legacy and the new initiatives: The Ezekiel Nkosi Ethical Research Laboratories [ENERL? No wonder they just call it Nkosi Labs] and the Department of Science and Technology. Well, they were close. Iñez' speech goes thus:

Iñez (at the podium, the Arcology towering behind her like the corpse of a giant slain demon, in an uncharacteristic reserved tone): "Welcome to Indiana, my friends. We stand here in the shadows of one of probably the greatest evil ever perpetrated by one man. The sheer scale of Anthony Connors' malevolence, and the lasting legacy of the Connors family and how and why it used its influence will probably never be known. In addition to my decision, I wanted to reinforce to the American People; I will never pass a law without talking to you about it. After my choices about St. Louis, I swore to you: I will never lie to you again. Leslie."

Leslie steps up to the podium; she is also calm and collected, a shift from her usual emotional, cynical self.

Leslie: "The decision to build the Ezekiel Nkosi Ethical Science Laboratories at the site of Anthony Connors' legacy was a complex and technically challenging one. How do we best take advantage of the *good* things the science left behind, while this [she points behind herself dramatically, indicating the Arcology] stands amid Indiana's bread basket? How best do we heal? We chose to remain here, at the site of such a terrible injustice, with the visible and invisible reminders of the Connors family erased. Our collective memory, and that of our history books and digital world, will carry the memory of the atrocities of this place into a new reality. [The online chatter is starting to get nervous now. It sounds like another "gotcha" moment is coming. Leslie's long pause and next line only reinforce this anxiety.] I, too, made a promise to never lie to you when I was appointed Media Director for the Lā'au campaign."

[Iñez steps back to the microphone, and Leslie steps back slightly so they are on the sides, their bodies perfectly framing the Arcology in the camera shot. They turn and stare silently at the ugly building for a moment, then both turn back and lean into the microphone.]

Iñez and Leslie, together (cheerfully): "But we do have a surprise for you."

[Together, they raise a small black box from behind the podium. It has a simple, covered button and a small antenna. They raise the cover and press the button together. The following things happen, in this order:

1. The Spire, containing Connors nightmares and the Cocytus control room [which have been examined and photographed *in situ* then ethically dismantled, returned to victims families, destroyed, or "buried so deep in the CIA vaults, Wild Bill's ghost can't find them"] is detonated in an enormous, pyrotechnic- and napalm-fueled fireball. Debris is scattered up to a kilometer away. 
2. The Arcology exterior "windows" (walls where there aren't windows) are blown outward, starting with the 68th floor and going downward in rapid succession.
3. The **ENTIRE UPPER STRUCTURE** of the Campus is detonated **all at once**. The Roof, the Campus, and the Arcology collapse and bury the Quarries. [Connors, a paranoid asshat, designed the Arcology, the Roof, the Reactor, and the Server Farm to survive if Indianapolis, Chicago, and Detroit all got hit with **H-Bombs** or equivilent MIRV warheads. Consequently the two things the heroes **want to save**, the Reactor and the Server farm, are actually not **in** The Quarries, but in (in the case of the Server) a special and expandable bunker dug into the Quarry walls, hardened against a direct strike and (in the case of the Reactor) on off-site location.]

Later, during the press conference before the dedication.
Reporter: "Madam President, how do you plan to fight future Anthony Connorses? Who's being considered for Secretary of Science and Technology? Do you have plans for your second term, if you win?"
Leslie: "Oh we're gonna win."
[Light laughter]
Reporter: "Madam President?"
Iñez: [Looks at Leslie, then looks into camera] "We have some ideas."
