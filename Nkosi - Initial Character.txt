This is contains a side note on my personal history, so log that and acknowledge, then let's talk about The General, he needs some development:

My military history should also inform you a lot about how General Ezekiel Nkosi is depicted. I served with a **lot**, and I mean a **LOT** of children of immigrants and guys and gals who enlisted even though they weren't born in the US. He's a testament to (well, a lot of things, see below, but specifically) the United States Military's troubled history with **inclusion**. Just google the words "don't ask don't tell" to see what I mean. Now trans soldiers and sailors are being targeted by conservatives, and it **really, really pisses me off**. So Nkosi is a monument for all the **undervalued contributions and sacrifices minorities and immigrants have made to this twisted, bizarre, amazing experiment that we call America.** I want this message to be ABUNDANTLY clear in the narrative, no subtlety. The rest of his character is a little more nuanced.

1. He's a first-generation natural born citizen. His parents fled the civil war-torn Central African country of his ancestors and came to the US as **refugees** (I'm not naming a specific country, and I chose a common surname in several of the region's cultures, for a reason [Note 1]). His deliberately ambigious origin and common name is not meant as a **narrative shorthand**, but to call attention to the use of that device and the problems associated with it. This information will be included in the non-script material I publish with the show.

2. He's "old school" military. When Iñez and Leslie bring him in on The Plan (because they need a military person they can trust), it is **Nkosi** that recommends the show of force, including using the straight-up "kill you and the man next to you" tactic on anyone who resists, ironically suggesting it will probably "be Nazis anyway" (foreshadowing! yay!). When Iñez and Leslie balk at this idea, he calmly explains it's the only way to control a crowd that size when you don't know how they will react to The Agenda Film, and that he will not cooperate if they don't follow his military advice. His inspirations are real-world generals who, when offering the **advice they were asked for**, are flatly ignored (see Colin Powell in the early War on Terror).

3. While his death is a powerful motivating factor in the narrative of the second season, it's also a bit of foreshadowing of Connors' demise. Although, it's also also the first glimpse into one of Connors' nasty proclivities: when the camera frames his dead body on top of the destroyed limo, his **ribbon brick** is missing. It later shows up in Connors' Trophy Room. The goal here is to use both blatant and subtle foreshadowing in one shot.

4. He's an **artifact** of an America he no longer recognizes. His death and "scandal" (CSAM, treason) are so obviously out of character for the people who knew him that it's immediately suspicious. Connors' split-second decision to use AFD as the company Nkosi "stole" from was a tactical error: it immediately put AFD in Leslie's crosshairs. This happens because Connors doesn't understand the concepts of **patriotism**, **loyalty**, and **righteous conviction**, dismissing them all as fool's errands. In the world I've created, he's not far off the truth. My "Black Mirror" approach to tech questions ("What's the worst that could happen? Seriously, **the absolute worst** that could happen?") is in stark contrast to Nkosi's traditional values. His death is also a symbol of the "death" of **20th Century American Exceptionalism** for good and bad (which can be explored in a different narrative, but I want the symbolism in this movie).


[Note 1]: Although Nkosi doesn't know this, and never finds out while he's alive, the current condition of the nation of his parents is because of Connors. Connors set up an **Idi Amin**-adjacent dictator in the country after using a military coup to overthrow the democratically elected government that evolved from the horrific civil war: Years of progress and millions of deaths wasted because some asshole on the other side of the world wanted some stupid, shitty rocks (Uranium in this case, a reference to the problems **Nigeria** is having). This is a very obvious and heavy handed attempt to draw attention to the long-lasting effects of **colonialism** in the developing world, and **modern colonialism**. This point will also be driven home with all the subtlety of an **fuel-air explosive**.
