### The Governor: Iñez Lā'au
**Codenames:** The Governor, Madam Governor, Madam President
**Synopsis:** Iñez Lā'au is a preternaturally charismatic and astute politician of mixed Hawaiian and Puerto Rican descent. Her backstory is rooted in a childhood spent partially on the streets of San Juan, Puerto Rico, which gives her an unassailable moral compass regarding the plight of the downtrodden. She is driven by a profound exasperation with a broken political system and is compelled to act after the passage of an abhorrent law targeting children. Her public-facing confidence is a façade for a private idealism that has been tempered by a cynical reality. She is the central protagonist of both films, serving as the primary narrative engine. In **Madam Governor**, she orchestrates a high-stakes political gambit that brings down her enemies. In **Madam President**, she is a leader besieged by the unforeseen consequences of her own actions.
**Casting:** Zendaya, whose emotional gravitas and commanding presence make her a perfect fit for a character with such complex inner conflict.

### The President: Dudley "Duke" Connors
**Codenames:** The President
**Synopsis:** Dudley "Duke" Connors is a theatrical and corpulent man of genuine charisma, but his potent magnetism belies a complete lack of conscience. He is, in actuality, a powerful puppet for his more sinister father, and his motivations are driven by pure ego and a gluttonous hunger for power. He is the public-facing instrument for the cabal's grander design. He is the main antagonist of **Madam Governor**, and his oppressive legislation is the inciting incident that forces The Governor to act. His defeat and imprisonment at the end of the first film are a crucial part of the satire, as it reveals that he was never the true enemy. His ultimate fate is one of irrelevance.
**Casting:** Aaron Eckhart, who is adept at portraying charismatic figures with a dark interior. His ability to project both charisma and an underlying menace makes him an ideal fit.

### The Host: Leslie Von der Linde-Khan
**Codenames:** The Host
**Synopsis:** Leslie is a masculine-presenting, non-binary trans person who embodies the contradictory spirit of the modern digital age. Their public persona is that of a sardonic but genial vlogger, whose deadpan humor and incisive commentary have garnered a massive online following. Privately, they are a bitterly cynical and nihilistic individual who has become disillusioned with the very fame that elevated them. Their backstory is one of personal liberation through the internet, a platform where they were able to discover and express their identity after a childhood of repression. In **Madam Governor**, they function as a Greek chorus and narrative conduit, providing the audience with on-the-ground commentary. In **Madam President**, their role transitions from an observer to a pivotal hero, using their crowdsourced hacktivism to become The Governor’s co-protagonist.
**Casting:** Eliot Page, who would bring unparalleled authenticity and powerful emotional resonance to the role.

### The Father: Anthony Connors (born Anton Chikunov)
**Codenames:** The Father, The Leader
**Synopsis:** Anthony Connors is the diminutive and ascetic mastermind behind the entire conspiracy. In stark contrast to his son's theatrical extravagance, he is a man of quiet, strategic ruthlessness. His motivations are rooted in a desire for total, discreet control, and he sees American democracy as a chaotic and inefficient system, a market ripe for domination. He is the principal architect of the fascist plot, leveraging his immense wealth and clandestine connections to orchestrate the chaos that his son presides over. In **Madam Governor**, he is the hidden antagonist, an almost mythical figure revealed only in the final scene. In **Madam President**, he emerges from the shadows as the central, overt antagonist, whose plot to stage a military coup becomes the primary threat.
**Casting:** Stanley Tucci, whose calm, measured demeanor and immense screen presence would make him a quietly menacing and formidable villain.

### The Tech Mogul: (No Name Yet)
**Codenames:** The Tech Mogul
**Synopsis:** A product of the digital age, the Tech Mogul is a fusion of a charismatic "techbro" and a cynical capitalist. His public persona as a bombastic visionary conceals a cold, opportunistic individual who is motivated by the exploitation of data and misinformation for financial gain. His backstory is a tragic descent from idealism to nihilism. He began as an innovator but evolved into a ruthless pragmatist who profits from human venality. In **Madam Governor**, he is a secondary antagonist who provides the technological infrastructure for the cabal. In **Madam President**, his assassination by a patsy—manipulated by his own algorithms—drives the sequel's plot, as The Host uses crowdsourced hacktivism to uncover the cabal's plans.
**Casting:** Colin Farrell, an incredibly versatile actor who could embody the character's public bravado and inner moral decay.

### The General: Ezekiel Nkosi
**Codenames:** The General
**Synopsis:** Ezekiel Nkosi is a career military officer and a man of unwavering principle who believes in the democratic ideals the military is sworn to protect. His loyalty is to the Constitution, not a political party. He initially supports The Governor's plan, believing it to be a necessary evil. However, his idealism is tested when he witnesses The Father's true and totalitarian ambition. He serves as a tragic moral compass. His final, single dissenting vote against the cabal's true agenda is a powerful moment of defiance that makes him a martyr. His death in the first film sets the stage for the second, where his memory inspires The Governor to fight the true enemy.
**Casting:** Giancarlo Esposito, who has the perfect acting range to portray a conflicted but principled character operating under a code of honor.
